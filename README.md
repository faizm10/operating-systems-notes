## Overview
- **Operating System (OS)** is software that manages the computerâ€™s hardware.
- Acts as a **middleman** between the user and the computer hardware.
- A computer system is composed of four components:
  1. **Hardware**
  2. **Operating System**
  3. **Application Programs**
  4. **User**

## Key Definitions

### Hardware
- The **CPU**, memory devices, input/output (I/O) devices, and any other **physical components** that are part of a computer.

### Application Program
- A program designed for **end-user execution**, such as a word processor, spreadsheet, compiler, or web browser.

### Ease of Use
- The amount of **difficulty and complexity** involved in using some aspect of computing.

### Resource Utilization
- The amount of a given **resource** (hardware or software) that is being used.

### Embedded Computer
- A computer system within a **larger system** (such as a car) that performs **specific, limited functions** and usually has little or no user interface.

### Resource Allocator
- An operating system or application that **determines how resources are to be used**.

### Control Program
- A program that **manages the execution** of user programs to **prevent errors and improper use** of the computer. Especially manages I/O devices.

### Moore's Law
- A prediction that the **number of transistors** on an integrated circuit would **double every eighteen months**.

### Kernel
- The OS component **running at all times** after system boot. It is the **core of the OS**.

### System Program
- A program **associated with the operating system** but not necessarily part of the kernel.

### Middleware
- A set of **software frameworks** that provide additional services to **application developers**.
